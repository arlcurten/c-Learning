The EOF flag is only set once a read tries to read past the end of the file. 
If I have a 3 byte file, and I only read 3 bytes, EOF is false, because I've not tried to read past the end of the file yet. 
While this seems confusing for files, which typically know their size, 
EOF is not known until a read is attempted on some devices, such as pipes and network sockets.

EOF是一個flag，要先做read，讀到文件的結尾符號後，才會被設成true
因此如果是用 
while(file.eof()) 
{
  cin >> variable  //read
}

會遇到一開始flag還是false，但是讀了以後才發現已經是結尾，flag=True，下一次迴圈進來的時候才跳開
