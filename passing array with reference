void foo(int * x);
void foo(int x[100]);
void foo(int x[]);
These three are different ways of declaring the same function. They're all treated as taking an int * parameter, you can pass any size array to them.

void foo(int (&x)[100]);
This only accepts arrays of 100 integers. You can safely use sizeof on x

void foo(int & x[100]); // error
This is parsed as an "array of references" - which isn't legal.

##倒數第二個是正確的方法，為把X array當作reference。
##最後一個不對，因為這樣子變成pass 一個reference array。
